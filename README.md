# Quinidine-Model

Whole-body parent-metabolite PBPK model of quinidine as CYP2D6 perpetrator and CYP3A4 and P-gp victim drug

## Repository files
A whole-body PBPK model of quinidine, evaluated within a comprehensive CYP2D6-CYP3A4-P-gp DD(G)I modeling network is provided.
The model snapshot contains simulations of the clinical studies used during model development, including the respective observed data digitized from literature reports. For further details, please refer to [[1](#reference)].
